# Introduction

Privacy focused tools for productivity and mental wellbeing

## Philosophy

### Fully open source

All code will be public so you can verify exactly what it's doing.

### You own your data

Your data is in your hands. You can choose how you back it up, if at all.

### Zero telemetry

We don't phone home at all. In fact there is no home. We don't own any servers and don't hold any data.

### Encryption by default

Seamless encryption by default. So your data is always safe regardless of where you choose to store it.

### Self hosted

You run the applications, so you're in complete control. No vendor lock-in, no relying on a centralised authority.

### Mobile support

Safely take only your necessary data with you when needed and without your data ever leaving your control.
